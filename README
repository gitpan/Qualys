Qualys version 0.01
===================

Connect to the Qualys scanner API

This module is a wrapper for connecting and using the QualysGuard API for all Qualys partners. It
will take care of authentication and creating the correct uri based on the options provided and
the selected API script.

individual appplications using perl. The QualysGuard partners can access security auditing, network discovery, preferences,
remediation ticket updates, and user enrollment functions using this interface.
